# Evolution Simulation: Apes → Humans

This is a small browser-based agent simulation that demonstrates simple evolutionary dynamics. Agents ("apes") move, eat food, reproduce with mutation, and over time population averages (speed, vision, intelligence) may shift. When averages cross thresholds the UI will label the population as "Ape", "Hominin", or "Human".

How to run
- Open `c:\\evolution_gameindex.html` in your browser (double-click or use "Open with" → your browser).

Controls
- Start / Pause / Reset
- Speed slider to speed up the simulation

Notes & extensions
- This is intentionally simple: genes are numeric and reproduction is asexual.
- Ideas to extend: sexual reproduction, energy cost for large vision, variable food generation, obstacles, recording history, saving genomes.
